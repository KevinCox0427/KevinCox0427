# Hey there!

### About Me

My name is Kevin Cox, and I'm a full-stack developer and graphic artist. I love all things code and art, and even better, both!
I love to help people, and nothing excites me more than hearing a client say •"Everyone loves the new look of the website."• or •"This website is so much faster now!"•
Since I'm a developer with an artistic perfectionism, I strive to thoroughly understand every code library I use and every pixel I create with a focused purpose.

### Some of my recent builds:

[My new portfolio site](https://github.com/KevinCox0427/Portfolio-Redo): A React-based website to update the projects I've worked on throughout the years. It uses a Python backend with a typescript-node-express server running simultaneously to render and hydrate the React content.

[Materials Matter Project](https://github.com/KevinCox0427/Materials-Matter-App): A SERN (MySQL-React-Node-Express) stack 

Coming soon :eyes:: An Angular/.Net front-end builder.
