# Hey there!

### About Me

Looking for work: &nbsp;[Resume](https://www.dreamstate.graphics/about) &nbsp;[Portfolio](https://www.dreamstate.graphics)\
\
My name is Kevin Cox, and I'm a full-stack developer and graphic artist. I love all things code and art, and even better, both!
I enjoy helping people, and nothing excites me more than hearing a client say *"Everyone loves the new look of the website."* or *"This website is so much faster now!"*
Since I'm a developer with an artistic perfectionism, I strive to thoroughly understand every code library I use and every pixel I create with a focused purpose.

### Some of my recent builds:

[My new portfolio site](https://github.com/KevinCox0427/Portfolio-Redo): A React-based website to update the projects I've worked on throughout the years. It uses a Python backend with an Express server running simultaneously to render and hydrate the React content.

[Materials Matter Prototype](https://github.com/KevinCox0427/Materials-Matter-App): A teaching materials application for professors to create "maps" for students to view instead of a slideshow when lecturing. Students simultaneously can log on and view the maps, while also being able to comment directly on top to increase student engagement. A SERN (MySQL-React-Node-Express) stack with Socket.io endpoint for real-time commenting.

[Angular Arcade Hokcey](https://github.com/KevinCox0427/Angular-Arcade-Hockey): An Angular/Java multiplayer videogame based on NES Ice Hockey.
